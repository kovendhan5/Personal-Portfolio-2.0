2. Example: `<Image src="/profile.jpg" alt="Profile" width={300} height={300} />`



2. Code splitting:

1. Utilize Next.js automatic code splitting for faster initial load times



3. Server-side rendering:

1. Implement getServerSideProps for data fetching on the server
2. Example:

```javascriptreact
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const data = await res.json()
  return { props: { data } }
}
```





4. Lazy loading:

1. Use dynamic imports for components not needed on initial load
2. Example: `const DynamicChart = dynamic(() => import('../components/Chart'))`

3. Ensuring sufficient color contrast:

1. Use tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker to verify your color choices



4. Making the site keyboard navigable:

1. Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and activated with a keyboard
